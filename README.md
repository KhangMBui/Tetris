## Introduction

The Tetris Game is a classic puzzle video game where the player must strategically arrange falling blocks or tetrominoes to clear lines and score points. This Java-based Tetris Game project provides an enjoyable gaming experience and is built with a graphical user interface.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Experience the timeless gameplay of the classic Tetris Game.

- **Random Piece Generation**: Randomly generates Tetris pieces (tetrominoes) for added variety and challenge.

- **Piece Rotation**: Rotate Tetris pieces to fit into available spaces and create solid lines.

- **Grid Management**: Automatically checks and clears full lines when they are completed.

- **Game Over Detection**: Detects when the game is over, signaling the end of the game.

## Game Controls

- Use the arrow keys to move the current Tetris piece left, right, or down.

- Press the "Up" arrow key to rotate the Tetris piece.

## Getting Started

1. Launch the Tetris Game.

2. Use the arrow keys to move the Tetris piece left, right, or down.

3. Press the "Up" arrow key to rotate the Tetris piece to fit it into available spaces.

4. Press the "Space" key to immediately drop the Tetris piece.

5. Strategically arrange Tetris pieces to form complete horizontal lines.

6. When a horizontal line is completed, it will be cleared from the grid, and you will earn points.

7. Continue playing and clearing lines to achieve the highest score possible.

## Game Over

The game is over when the Tetris piece reaches the top of the game grid, and it cannot be placed in the available space. At this point, the game will end, and your final score will be displayed.
